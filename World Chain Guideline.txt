Solidity
Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs that govern the behavior of accounts within the Ethereum state.

Solidity is a curly-bracket language designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It is influenced by C++, Python, and JavaScript. You can find more details about which languages Solidity has been inspired by in the language influences section.

Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries, and complex user-defined types, among other features.

With Solidity, you can create contracts for uses such as voting, crowdfunding, blind auctions, and multi-signature wallets.

When deploying contracts, you should use the latest released version of Solidity. Apart from exceptional cases, only the latest version receives security fixes. Furthermore, breaking changes, as well as new features, are introduced regularly. We currently use a 0.y.z version number to indicate this fast pace of change.

Warning

Solidity recently released the 0.8.x version that introduced a lot of breaking changes. Make sure you read the full list.

Ideas for improving Solidity or this documentation are always welcome, read our contributors guide for more details.

Getting Started
1. Understand the Smart Contract Basics

If you are new to the concept of smart contracts, we recommend you to get started by digging into the “Introduction to Smart Contracts” section, which covers the following:

A simple example smart contract written in Solidity.

Blockchain Basics.

The Ethereum Virtual Machine.

2. Get to Know Solidity

Once you are accustomed to the basics, we recommend you read the “Solidity by Example” and “Language Description” sections to understand the core concepts of the language.

3. Install the Solidity Compiler

There are various ways to install the Solidity compiler, simply choose your preferred option and follow the steps outlined on the installation page.

Hint

You can try out code examples directly in your browser with the Remix IDE. Remix is a web browser-based IDE that allows you to write, deploy and administer Solidity smart contracts, without the need to install Solidity locally.

Warning

As humans write software, it can have bugs. Therefore, you should follow established software development best practices when writing your smart contracts. This includes code review, testing, audits, and correctness proofs. Smart contract users are sometimes more confident with code than their authors, and blockchains and smart contracts have their own unique issues to watch out for, so before working on production code, make sure you read the Security Considerations section.

4. Learn More

If you want to learn more about building decentralized applications on Ethereum, the Ethereum Developer Resources can help you with further general documentation around Ethereum, and a wide selection of tutorials, tools, and development frameworks.

If you have any questions, you can try searching for answers or asking on the Ethereum StackExchange, or our Gitter channel.

# Deploy Smart Contracts

> Deploy a HelloWorldChain smart contract to World Chain Sepolia using Foundry: setup, build, test, fund, and create.

In this tutorial, we will use the [Solidity programming language](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.28/) to write the `HelloWorldChain` smart contract for World Chain.
Solidity is a programming language that can compile to EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) bytecode which can be executed on the World Chain EVM.
We will also be using the [Foundry CLI](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) toolkit, which has a lot of tools to help build, test and interact with Solidity programs.

## Download development tools

First, we need to install the Foundry CLI toolkit and the Solidity compiler. Solidity comes with a compiler called `solc` which we will use to compile the `HelloWorldChain` contract. The Foundry CLI
will automatically download the right version of the Solidity compiler for you during the compilation process using `forge build`.

<CodeGroup>
  `bash Install Foundry curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash `
</CodeGroup>

## Create a Foundry project

Open your terminal of choice, navigate to a directory where you want to create your project, and run the following command to create a new Foundry project:

<CodeGroup>
  ````bash Create a new Foundry project forge init hello-world-chain && cd theme={null}
  hello-world-chain ```
  </CodeGroup>

  Now that you have created a new Foundry project, you can start writing your smart contract. All smart contracts in Foundry projects are stored in the `src` directory.
  If you are using VSCode, it should look something like this:

  ![Foundry 1](/images/docs/world-chain/foundry-1.png)

  ## Write the HelloWorldChain contract

  First, delete the template file called Counter.sol in the /src directory:

  <CodeGroup>```bash Delete Template rm src/Counter.sol ```</CodeGroup>

  Next, create a new file called HelloWorldChain.sol in the /src directory and add the following code to it:

  <CodeGroup>
  ```solidity HelloWorldChain.sol
  // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
  pragma solidity ^0.8.28;

  contract HelloWorldChain {
  string private word;

    // Constructor that sets the initial word to "Hello World Chain!"
    constructor() {
        word = "Hello World Chain!";
    }

    // Setter function to update the word
    function setWord(string memory newWord) public {
        word = newWord;
    }

    // Getter function to return the current word
    function getWord() public view returns (string memory) {
        return word;
    }

  }

  ````
</CodeGroup>

This contract has a `word` variable that stores a string and two functions: `setWord` to update the word and `getWord` to return the current word.

## Update Scripts and Tests

Since we deleted `Counter.sol`, we need to update or remove the scripts and tests that reference it to prevent compilation errors.

**Delete the `script` directory**

The script directory contains scripts that import `Counter.sol`. Since we no longer have `Counter.sol`, we can delete the entire script directory to avoid any compilation issues:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Delete Script Directory theme={null}
  rm -rf script
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Replace** `Counter.t.sol` with `HelloWorldChain.t.sol`

In the test directory, delete the existing `Counter.t.sol` and create a new test file called `HelloWorldChain.t.sol` and add the following simple tests:

<CodeGroup>
  ```solidity HelloWorldChain.t.sol theme={null}
  // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
  pragma solidity ^0.8.28;

  import "forge-std/Test.sol";
  import "../src/HelloWorldChain.sol";

  contract HelloWorldChainTest is Test {
  HelloWorldChain helloWorldChain;

      function setUp() public {
          helloWorldChain = new HelloWorldChain();
      }

      function testInitialWord() public view {
          string memory expected = "Hello World Chain!";
          string memory actual = helloWorldChain.getWord();
          assertEq(actual, expected);
      }

      function testSetWord() public {
          string memory newWord = "Hello Foundry!";
          helloWorldChain.setWord(newWord);
          string memory actual = helloWorldChain.getWord();
          assertEq(actual, newWord);
      }

  }

  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Now You can Run tests:**

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Test the contract theme={null}
  forge test
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Compile the contract

To compile the `HelloWorldChain` contract, run the following command:

<CodeGroup>`bash Compile the contract forge build `</CodeGroup>

The `forge build` command will compile the contract using the Solidity compiler and generate the necessary artifacts in the `artifacts` directory.

## Generate a wallet

To deploy the `HelloWorldChain` contract to World Chain Sepolia, you will need a wallet with some World Chain Sepolia ETH. An easy way to generate a
wallet using the Foundry CLI is to run the following command:

<CodeGroup>`bash Generate a wallet cast wallet new `</CodeGroup>

`cast` is a versatile set of utility functions and commands for Solidity development. In this case, we are using one of its many built-in features to generate a wallet with one account.

<Note>
  Never share your private key with anyone and always make sure that you don't
  upload them to code versioning tools like Git and hosting platforms like
  GitHub. Research best practices for private key management in order to avoid
  loss of funds.
</Note>

The output of the command will look something like this:

````
Successfully created new keypair.
Address:     0xB815A0c4bC23930119324d4359dB65e27A846A2d
Private key: 0xcc1b30a6af68ea9a9917f1dda20c927704c5cdb2bbe0076901a8a0e40bf997c5
```

## Fund your wallet

Now that you have a wallet, you need to fund it with some World Chain Sepolia ETH. You can get some World Chain Sepolia ETH from the [World Chain Sepolia faucet](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/world-chain-sepolia) operated by Alchemy.
In the form on the faucet page, enter the address of your wallet which you generated above and click the "Send me ETH" button. If you have any issues please send us a message in the developer
group chat on [Telegram](https://t.me/worldcoindevelopers) or [Discord](https://world.org/discord).

## Deploy the contract

Now that you have a wallet and you funded it with World Chain Sepolia ETH, you can deploy the `HelloWorldChain` contract to World Chain Sepolia using the following `forge create` command:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Deploy the contract forge create
  src/HelloWorldChain.sol:HelloWorldChain --rpc-url
  https://worldchain-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/public --private-key
  0xcc1b30a6af68ea9a9917f1dda20c927704c5cdb2bbe0076901a8a0e40bf997c5 ```
</CodeGroup>

Here, we are using the `<path>:<contractname>` format to specify the contract. This tells Foundry where to find the contract file (src/HelloWorldChain.sol) and which contract within the file (HelloWorldChain) to deploy.
We also use the `--rpc-url` flag to specify the RPC URL of the World Chain Sepolia network and the `--private-key` flag to specify the private key of the wallet we generated earlier.
On top of this we can also provide other flags like `-vvvvv` to get more verbose output from the deployment process, `--verify` to verify the contract on [Worldscan](https://worldscan.org) or [Blockscout](https://worldchain-sepolia.explorer.alchemy.com/) (alongside with an `--etherscan-api-key` flag) and
several other flags to toggle different features that you can find more about in the [Foundry documentation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/).

And that's it! You have successfully deployed a smart contract to World Chain Sepolia. You can interact with the contract using `forge script` scripts, using a block explorer or any other EVM library like [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/), [alloy-rs](https://github.com/alloy-rs/alloy/), and many others.
````

# Deploy a World ID Template App

> Deploy the World ID on-chain template to a World Chain Sepolia fork with Foundry; configure env, contracts, and local web.

In this tutorial we are going to deploy a [World ID template app](https://github.com/worldcoin/world-id-onchain-template) on a World Chain Sepolia local fork using anvil.
This app will be a simple web application that allows users to create a World ID proof of personhood and verify it.
The app will be deployed on World Chain Sepolia and will interact with the `WorldIDRouter` smart contract
to verify the ZK proofs of personhood.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have the following tools installed:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (usually pre-installed on most systems)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [pnpm](https://yarnpkg.com/) (or equivalent like npm, yarn or bun)
* [Foundry CLI](https://book.getfoundry.sh/)

## Clone template

First, clone the World ID template app repository from GitHub:

```bash  theme={null}
git clone https://github.com/worldcoin/world-id-onchain-template.git && cd world-id-onchain-template
```

## Install dependencies

Next, install the dependencies for the World ID template app:

```bash  theme={null}
pnpm install
```

## Build the smart contracts

Next we are going to compile the smart contracts for the World ID template app:

```bash  theme={null}
cd contracts && forge build
```

## Understanding World ID

Before we deploy the World ID template app, let's take a look at the smart contracts that are part of the app:

<CodeGroup>
  ```solidity contracts/src/Contract.sol theme={null}
  // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
  pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

  import { ByteHasher } from "./helpers/ByteHasher.sol";
  import { IWorldID } from "./interfaces/IWorldID.sol";

  contract Contract {
  using ByteHasher for bytes;

      ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
      ///                                  ERRORS                                ///
      //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

      /// @notice Thrown when attempting to reuse a nullifier
      error DuplicateNullifier(uint256 nullifierHash);

      /// @dev The World ID instance that will be used for verifying proofs
      IWorldID internal immutable worldId;

      /// @dev The contract's external nullifier hash
      uint256 internal immutable externalNullifier;

      /// @dev The World ID group ID (always 1)
      uint256 internal immutable groupId = 1;

      /// @dev Whether a nullifier hash has been used already. Used to guarantee an action is only performed once by a single person
      mapping(uint256 => bool) internal nullifierHashes;

      /// @param nullifierHash The nullifier hash for the verified proof
      /// @dev A placeholder event that is emitted when a user successfully verifies with World ID
      event Verified(uint256 nullifierHash);

      /// @param _worldId The WorldID router that will verify the proofs
      /// @param _appId The World ID app ID
      /// @param _actionId The World ID action ID
      constructor(IWorldID _worldId, string memory _appId, string memory _actionId) {
      	worldId = _worldId;
      	externalNullifier = abi.encodePacked(abi.encodePacked(_appId).hashToField(), _actionId).hashToField();
      }

      /// @param signal An arbitrary input from the user, usually the user's wallet address (check README for further details)
      /// @param root The root of the Merkle tree (returned by the JS widget).
      /// @param nullifierHash The nullifier hash for this proof, preventing double signaling (returned by the JS widget).
      /// @param proof The zero-knowledge proof that demonstrates the claimer is registered with World ID (returned by the JS widget).
      /// @dev Feel free to rename this method however you want! We've used `claim`, `verify` or `execute` in the past.
      function verifyAndExecute(address signal, uint256 root, uint256 nullifierHash, uint256[8] calldata proof) public {
      	// First, we make sure this person hasn't done this before
      	if (nullifierHashes[nullifierHash]) revert DuplicateNullifier(nullifierHash);

      	// We now verify the provided proof is valid and the user is verified by World ID
      	worldId.verifyProof(
      		root,
      		groupId,
      		abi.encodePacked(signal).hashToField(),
      		nullifierHash,
      		externalNullifier,
      		proof
      	);

      	// We now record that the user has done this, so they can't do it again (proof of uniqueness)
      	nullifierHashes[nullifierHash] = true;

      	// Finally, execute your logic here, for example issue a token, NFT, etc...
      	// Make sure to emit some kind of event afterwards!

      	emit Verified(nullifierHash);
      }

  }

  ```
</CodeGroup>

This contract has all the necessary pieces that any app that wants to integrate World ID proofs of personhood will require.
The World ID docs have a [detailed explanation](https://docs.worldcoin.org/world-id) of how the World ID system works and how to integrate it into your app.
But we will go over the main parts of the contract here:

1. The `Contract` contract is the main contract that will be deployed to World Chain Sepolia. It has a constructor that
   takes the `IWorldID` interface, the app ID and the action ID as parameters. The `IWorldID` interface is the World ID router
   that will verify the proofs, the app ID is the ID of the app can be created by the developer using the
   [World ID Developer Portal](https://developer.worldcoin.org/login) and that the action ID is the ID of the action that the user
   is performing which will be generated automatically by the [IDKit SDK](https://docs.worldcoin.org/reference/idkit) and derived
   from `action` string defined in the Developer Portal.
2. The [`nullifierHashes` mapping](https://docs.worldcoin.org/reference/contracts#sybil-resistance) is used to keep track of
   the nullifier hashes that have been used already. This is used to guarantee that an action is only performed once by a single
   person in order to achieve sybil resistance.
3. The `verifyAndExecute` function is the main function that will be called by the user to verify their proof of personhood.
   It takes the user's wallet address, the root of the Merkle tree, the nullifier hash, and the proof as parameters.
4. The function first checks if the nullifier hash has been used already and reverts if it has.
5. It then verifies the proof using the `worldId.verifyProof` function which is part of the `IWorldID` interface.
6. If the proof is valid, the function records the nullifier hash and executes the logic of the app. In this case, it emits
   the `Verified` event.

If you want an example of a production application which uses the World ID protocol, you can check out the
[Worldcoin grants contracts](https://github.com/worldcoin/worldcoin-grants-contracts).
Specifically, the [`RecurringGrantDrop.sol`](https://github.com/worldcoin/worldcoin-grants-contracts/blob/main/src/RecurringGrantDrop.sol)
contract which uses the World ID protocol to verify that the user is a unique human before they can claim a grant.

## Deploy template app

First, you have to go to a node provider that supports World Chain Sepolia. You can use [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)
or any of the other providers listed in the [World Chain documentation](/world-chain/providers/nodes). Once you have a node provider
account, you need to get an RPC URL for the World Chain Sepolia network. For a simple deployment, the public RPC URL is sufficient.
However, for doing a fork deployment, you will need to run a local fork of World Chain Sepolia using anvil which requires higher
requirements on the RPC provider for forking the network.

First, we will fork the World Chain Sepolia network using anvil:

```bash  theme={null}
# Substitute the RPC_URL with the RPC URL of the World Chain Sepolia network
anvil -f $RPC_URL
```

We also need to set three important environment variables that are required for the deployment of the World ID template app:

* `WORLD_ID_ROUTER`: The address of the World ID router contract that will verify the proofs (can be found in the [World ID documentation](https://docs.worldcoin.org/world-chain/reference/useful-contracts))
* `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID`: The app ID that was generated in the [Developer Portal](https://developer.worldcoin.org/login)
* `NEXT_PUBLIC_ACTION`: The action ID as configured in the [Developer Portal](https://developer.worldcoin.org/login)

Once the fork is running, you can deploy the World ID template app to the World Chain Sepolia network using the Foundry CLI:

```bash  theme={null}
# cd into the contracts directory
cd contracts
forge create --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 src/Contract.sol:Contract --constructor-args $WORLD_ID_ROUTER $NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID $NEXT_PUBLIC_ACTION
```

This command will deploy the `Contract` contract to the World Chain Sepolia network using the provided RPC URL and private key.

## Local Web Setup

Set up your environment variables in the `.env` file. You will need to set the following variables:

* `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID`: The app ID as configured in the [Worldcoin Developer Portal](https://developer.worldcoin.org).
* `NEXT_PUBLIC_ACTION`: The action ID as configured in the Worldcoin Developer Portal.
* `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_ID`: Your WalletConnect ID.
* `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: The address of the contract deployed in the previous step.

Back in the root directory of the World ID template app, you can start the local web server:

```bash  theme={null}
pnpm dev
```

The Contract ABI will be automatically re-generated and saved to `src/abi/ContractAbi.json` on each run of `pnpm dev`.

## Iterating

After making changes to the contract, you should:

* re-run the `forge create` command from above
* replace the `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` environment variable with the new contract address
* if your contract ABI has changed, restart the local web server

## Testing

You'll need to import the private keys on the local testnet into your wallet used for local development. The default development seed phrase is `test test test test test test test test test test test junk`.

<Note>
  This is only for local development. Do not use this seed phrase on mainnet or
  any public testnet.
</Note>

When connecting your wallet to the local development environment, you will be prompted to add the network to your wallet.

Use the [Worldcoin Simulator](https://simulator.worldcoin.org) in place of World App to scan the IDKit QR codes and generate the zero-knowledge proofs.

# Transaction Fees

> Understand World Chain fees: L2 execution vs L1 security costs, variability, and ways to optimize gas.

Every World Chain transaction consists of two costs: an L2 (execution) fee and an L1 (security) fee. The L2 fee is the cost to execute your transaction on the L2, while the L1 fee covers the estimated cost of publishing the transaction on the L1. Typically, the L1 security fee is higher than the L2 execution fee.

The L1 fee fluctuates depending on the volume of transactions on the L1. If your transaction timing is flexible, you can save on costs by submitting during periods of lower gas fees on the L1 (for example, weekends) or using products like [GasHawk](https://gashawk.io/) which schedule transactions during periods of low demand.

Similarly, the L2 fee can vary based on the number of transactions submitted to the L2. This dynamic adjustment works similarly to the L1; you can learn more about it [here](https://blog.thirdweb.com/eip-1559-ethereum-gas-fees/).

For additional details about fee calculation on World Chain, please refer to the relevant [op-stack developer documentation](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/transactions/fees).

# EVM Equivalence

> How World Chain achieves EVM equivalence via OP Stack, plus key parameter differences vs OP Mainnet and Ethereum.

World Chain is EVM-equivalent because it utilizes the [OP Stack](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/getting-started), a modular framework developed by Optimism,
which ensures compatibility with the [Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/). By leveraging the OP Stack,
World Chain can execute smart contracts and interact with decentralized applications designed for Ethereum
without any modifications. This equivalency enables seamless interoperability with Ethereum's ecosystem of applications and protocols.
The OP Stack's modularity also allows World Chain to implement scaling solutions and other customizations while maintaining the fundamental EVM equivalence,
ensuring a flexible yet consistent environment for developers and users alike.

## Differences between World Chain, OP Mainnet and Ethereum

Though the EVM remains unchanged across OP Stack (Superchain) chains compared to the Ethereum layer 1, there are some configurations of the execution clients that
do differ.

# How to Set Up a World Chain Node

Follow this guide to set up your own World Chain node.

## Overview

World Chain mainnet and testnet run on the OP Stack as part of the Superchain. We provide a simple Docker Compose configuration for running World Chain nodes, [simple-worldchain-node](https://github.com/worldcoin-foundation/simple-worldchain-node). If you're interested in building a node from source, see the [documentation from Optimism](https://docs.optimism.io/operators/node-operators/tutorials/node-from-source).

## Using `simple-worldchain-node`

`simple-worldchain-node` supports World Chain Mainnet and Sepolia, full nodes and archive nodes, and two execution clients: [op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth) and [op-reth](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth).

<Note>
  World Chain node snapshots for `op-geth` are available from Bware Labs [here](https://bwarelabs.com/snapshots/worldchain).
</Note>

### Installation

First, download [`simple-worldchain-node`](https://github.com/worldcoin-foundation/simple-worldchain-node) and create your `.env` file.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Download simple-worldchain-node theme={null}
  git clone https://github.com/worldcoin-foundation/simple-worldchain-node.git
  cd simple-worldchain-node
  cp .env.example .env
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Ensure you have installed Docker and Docker Compose by following [this guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#scenario-three-install-the-docker-compose-standalone).

### Configuration

Open your `.env` file in an editor of your choice. The following values must be configured before starting your node.

<ParamField body="NETWORK_NAME" type="worldchain-mainnet | worldchain-sepolia" required>
  Used to select which network the node connects to, either `worldchain-mainnet` or `worldchain-sepolia`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="COMPOSE_PROFILES" type="geth | reth" required>
  Used to select your execution client, either `geth` (default) or `reth` (experimental).
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="GETH_NODE_TYPE" type="full | archive" required>
  When using `op-geth`, determines which type of node to run. Either `full` (less storage, but only recent history) or `archive` (more storage, all history).
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="L1_RPC_ENDPOINT" type="URL" required>
  An L1 (Ethereum) RPC endpoint. We recommend using [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) or [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com), but any Ethereum RPC provider or archive node will work.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="L1_BEACON_RPC_ENDPOINT" type="URL" required>
  An L1 Beacon Archive RPC endpoint. Note that this is not the same as a standard RPC endpoint, as this is used to retrieve Blobs from the Ethereum Beacon Chain. We recommend using [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/).
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="L1_RPC_TYPE" type="string" required>
  Selects which RPC provider is set in `OP_NODE__RPC_ENDPOINT`. This allows for more efficient syncing given different RPC capabilities. Choose from `alchemy`, `quicknode`, `erigon`, or `basic` for other RPC providers.
</ParamField>

For details on optional settings, see the `simple-worldchain-node` [README](https://github.com/worldcoin-foundation/simple-worldchain-node?tab=readme-ov-file#optional-configurations).

### Running your node

To start your node in the background, run the following command from the `simple-worldchain-node` folder:

```bash  theme={null}
docker compose up -d --build
```

To view logs for your node, run the following command:

```bash  theme={null}
docker compose logs -f --tail 10
```

To shut down your node:

```bash  theme={null}
docker compose down
```

### Monitoring your node

A Grafana dashboard is included to monitor your node. Access it by visiting [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and logging in with these credentials:

* Username: `admin`
* Password: `worldchain`

### Upgrading your Node

When new versions of `op-geth`, `op-reth`, or `op-node` are released, we will update the `simple-worldchain-node` repository to use these new versions. You can then update your node to use these versions with the following commands:

```bash  theme={null}
git pull
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d --build
```

# Token Bridging Guide

## 1. Deploy your token on World Chain

Choose your preferred bridging framework and use it to deploy an ERC-20 for your token on World Chain.
We recommend using the framework provided by World Chain's [standard bridge contracts](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/blob/main/specs/protocol/bridges.md),
and deploying your token with the [OptimismMintableERC20Factory](/world-chain/developers/world-chain-contracts).
This deployment method offers guarantees that will streamline the approval process. If you opt for a different bridging framework,
it must be compatible with the standard bridge interface, or we may have difficulty supporting it.

## 2. Submit details for your token

Follow the instructions in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io) and submit a PR with the required details for your token.
You must specify a section for `worldchain-sepolia` and/or `worldchain` in your token's data.json file.
The submission is straightforward if your token is already listed on the Superchain token list.

## 3. Await final approval

The World team regularly reviews submissions, and you should receive a response within 24-72 hours, depending on whether the PR is submitted on a weekday, weekend, or holiday.
